    <h2> About Us </h2>
    <p>
      Hi, my name is Aramis Martinez. I'm a student trying to make a tool that combines elements of different apps out there.
      I got this idea after my ant start to have problems organizing her small business. She's a chiropractor, who wanted to 
      be able to make the process of making appointments easier on her. She also wanted to be able to track thing like her inventories.
      Yes she could use things like booksy for appontments and for the other stuff she could use a sheets app like google sheets.
      But I believe an app that can do all that in one place has alot of value so I setoff on making Bravus.

    <p> 
      Bravus is a simple dashboard that aim to have small appointment based business.
      We achive this by allowing Owners of the business control and manage key things on the dashboard.
      We first give them a platform where they can take client to make and manage profile that they can use
      to make appointments with the owners. We also give that a way for them to manage their inventories and 
      financials.
